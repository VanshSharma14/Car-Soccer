# Car-Soccer
 Source code for my car soccer game written in Lua.

#### I have not yet figured out a way to turn it into a .exe file so here's the steps to run it:
* Download the LOVE2D game engine from https://love2d.org/
* Place the love.exe application to a new folder.
* Download the project folder and place it in the same folder as the love.exe application.
* Simply drag and drop the project folder over the Love.exe application and enjoy :)

#### Collab?
* I have elaborate plans about what I would like to do with this game so I welcome collaborators.
* I use the LOVE2D game engien and windfield library for the physics of the game.
* All art is done by my with the help of a friend.
* If you would like to collaborate, please shoot me and E-Mail at ||Vansh.business14@gmail.com||
