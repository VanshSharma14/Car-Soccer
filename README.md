# Car-Soccer
 Source code for my car soccer game written in Lua.

* This game uses the Love2D game engine and the windfield library.
* I have not yet worked out a way to make a .exe for the game but I will work that out soon.
* I have elaborate plans on what features and stuff I wish to implement for this game but due to college I haven't gotten around to it yet.
* If you wish to collaborate on this project with me, just shoot me an E-Mail at |Vansh.business14@gmail.com|
